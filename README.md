# Web Gui Overlay by H0l52
A easily customize-able GUI overlay that goes over the computer desktop. 

This project uses the pywin32 library (go check them out [HERE](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32)!)
And it uses the pyqt5 libraries. To install these do `pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine`.

## Downloads

To get a pre-combiled binary (made with pyinstaller), go to the releases tab in GitHub.

Otherwise you can clone the repository and build it for yourself!
